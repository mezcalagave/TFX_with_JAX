# TFX_with_JAX
Used Simple CNN model using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) and JAX(Flax)

# Description
This repository shows how to build Machine Learning Pipeline for Image Classification with TensorFlow Extended(TFX) ,  Vertex AI and Flax.

We use VGGNet based Flax model. Since we make a ML pipeline, VGGNet like model could be a good starting point.
